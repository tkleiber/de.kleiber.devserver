This is the repository for all blogs related to my virtual development server which you can find here:
https://develishdevelopment.wordpress.com/tag/virtual-development-server/

== Goals

* virtual development server to decoupling development from my computer
* testing some ideas and play with some new and old technologies
* components should be easy replaceable and should influence my computer as little as possible

== Create and Start Virtual Box via Vagrant as Base for Local Development

[source,bash]
----
vagrant up
vagrant destroy
----

== Create and Start Compute Instance in Oracle Cloud via Terraform for Remote Development

[source,bash]
----
terraform apply -auto-approve
terraform destroy -auto-approve
terraform init -upgrade
tail -F /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
----

== Planned features:

* Both should be based on same OS
* Docker containers for decoupling of technologies and components
** Jenkins for orchestrating the build and delivering process
** Sonarcube for Code Analysis
** Oracle Database Enterprise Edition 12c Oracle Database XE 11g
** Oracle Weblogic Server 12c
** Oracle ADF Runtime 12c
