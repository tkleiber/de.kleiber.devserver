== Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

== Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions[described by Michael Nygard].

For supporting this we use https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[ADR Tools] to create Architecture Decision Records via Git Bash support and then convert the generated files in https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7391-asciidoc[IntelliJ Asciidoc plugin] from Markdown to Asciidoc format.

== Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools[adr-tools].
