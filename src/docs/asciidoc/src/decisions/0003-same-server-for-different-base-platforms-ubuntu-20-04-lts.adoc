Date: 2021-05-03

== Status

Accepted

== Context

The Development Server should be combined from different Docker images. The Docker daemon must be run on different base platforms, the installation should be as similar as possible.

== Decision

At the time of this definition Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is available for:

* https://app.vagrantup.com/bento/boxes/ubuntu-20.04[Vagrant]
* https://docs.oracle.com/de-de/iaas/Content/Compute/References/images.htm[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Compute Instance]
* https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/ubuntu-2004-lts/9n6svws3rx71?activetab=pivot:overviewtab[Windows Store App for WLS 2]
* Docker Desktop

== Consequences

We will further work on the different platforms with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
